  content: "I was in your Sept 30 &amp; Oct 7 \"How to Organize your Digital Photos\".
    I have Windows XP Home Edition. I'm hoping you can help me find the \"Picture
    Tasks\"  on my Windows Explorer. When I go into Windows Explorer, My Documents,
    My Pictures--what I get is: Folders (on the left) and my picture folders (on the
    right).  I think you said if I want the \"Picture Tasks\" I should go to Start,
    My Pictures. I still do not get \"Picture Tasks\". I just get my picture folders.
    Help! Am I missing a step? Also, I might add that I do not have Picture Manager.
    Could this be why I do not get the \"Picture Tasks\"?\r\n\r\nThanks, I hope you
    can help me.\r\n\r\nMary Jeanne"

  content: This was so helpful.  I had changed to open jpg files to Adobe Photoshop
    for ease of making pictures clearer, more contrast, etc., but my husband was NOT
    happy about that.  I couldn't figure out how to change back to Picasa for viewing
    jpg files.  It was so easy to make that change and your instructions were simple
    and direct.  Thank you.

<p>When you buy a new digital camera, you are told (forced) to install the software that came with the camera "<strong>or else</strong> your camera will not work properly with your computer". This is, of course, total rubbish if you have purchased your camera within the last five years. I have taught hundreds of students and only a few had a digital camera that Windows XP did not recognize. The vast majority worked without installing a thing. </p>
<p>That's not to say that the software is all bad, but the software that is built into Windows works just as well. In fact, in most cases, I prefer it to all other software. It is a very lightweight program, so your photos will open up very quickly. So, <strong>how do you set Windows to open your JPG files</strong> instead of your custom software? It's easy: </p>
<blockquote><p>Simply right click on a JPG file and click properties.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/properties.jpg" alt="" title="properties" width="253" height="366" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-350" /></p>
<p></center></p>
<p>Then click the "Change" button:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/change.jpg" alt="" title="change" width="370" height="504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-355" /></center></p>
<p>Then select the "Windows Picture and Fax Viewer" and click the "OK" button: <em>(this is Windows' built in photo viewer)</em></p>
<p><center><img src="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture_viewer.jpg" alt="" title="picture_viewer" width="398" height="469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354" /></center></p>
<p>Now, the JPG Properties window should show the "Windows Picture and Fax Viewer" as the default viewer for JPG files:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/correct.jpg" alt="" title="correct" width="370" height="506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356" /></center></p>
<p>Now if you double click on a JPG file, it should open in the "Windows Picture and Fax Viewer":</p>
<p><center><a href="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/default_viewer.jpg"><img src="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/default_viewer.jpg" alt="" title="default_viewer" width="300" height="210" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-357" /></a></center></p>
<p>The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer is very simple. It allows you to browse forward and backward and a few other edits. Click through to see a description of some of the most useful buttons:</p>
<p><center><a href="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/toolbar.jpg"><img src="http://brockangelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/toolbar.jpg" alt="" title="toolbar" width="300" height="86" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-364" /></a></center></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should also add that this works for any file type. So if your videos are opening with iTunes and you want them to open with Windows Media Player, you simply follow the same steps, substituting those programs and file types for the ones listed above. I hope this helps! :)</p>
