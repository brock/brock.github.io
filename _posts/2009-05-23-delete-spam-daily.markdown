<p>Version 1.0.2</p>
<blockquote><p>View plugin at WordPress.org: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/delete-spam-daily/">Delete Spam Daily 1.0.2</a><br />
Direct Download here: <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/delete-spam-daily.zip">Download 'Delete Spam Daily 1.0.2'</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This plugin schedules a daily event using wp_cron that deletes all comments marked "spam" in the database, then optimizes the database.</p>
<p>Brief reason why I made such a low-tech plugin:</p>
<p>Akismet catches all the spam, but when I was looking at the size of my backups one day, I noticed that there were large numbers of comment spam across several sites that were undeleted and they made the databases fairly large. So I setup a cron job on my server that deletes the spam.</p>
<p>Since I had never written a plugin, I thought this might be helpful for those who do not have a dedicated server, shell access to their site, or the knowledge of (or interest in ) cron to set this up.</p>
<p>Spam is not deleted until you start the schedule after the plugin is activated. I created buttons to start and stop the schedule if you need that layer of control. There is also a button for deleting all spam manually.<br />

<p></p>
<p><strong>Changelog:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Version 1.0.2 - 5.28.09: Now optimizes the `wp_comments` table after spam is deleted. Updated DB call to allow for alternate wordpress table prefix. </li>
<li>Version 1.0.1 - 5.26.09: Minor update. `add_action` was added to the "Delete Spam Daily" button so it would actually delete spam once a day. :-) In addition to a "Stop Deleting Spam" button, a button was added that reschedules the cron to happen in 1 minute so you can be sure your crons are working right away. </li>
<li>Version 1.0 - 5.25.09: Initial Release. Included button to start deleting spam daily, and a button to delete spam immediately. Once the schedule was activated, it provided a button to stop the schedule. Shows current spam count and next scheduled delete.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have shell access to your server or have the ability to schedule cron jobs with your web host, you can schedule a cron job to accomplish this task. Read details <a href="http://brockangelo.com/2009/05/23/delete-comment-spam-using-a-cron-job/">here</a>.</p>
