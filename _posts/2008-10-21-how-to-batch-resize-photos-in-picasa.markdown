<p><strong>How to Batch Resize Photos in Picasa</strong></p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2954435971_95a90ec647.jpg" alt="picasa screenshot" width="500" height="400" /></center></p>
<p>If you want to resize your photos using Picasa, there is an easy way to do it. The tool you will use is called "<strong>Export</strong>" and it is located at the bottom of the Picasa screen. Export will make a copy of your photos, and will give you the option of what size you want the new copies to be, and where you want to save them. Don't worry, your original photos will stay right where they are.</p>
<p>To get started, we will need to choose the photos that we want to resize (or <em>Export</em>). We do this one of two ways. The first way is by Control-Clicking your photos (by holding down the "Ctrl" key on your keyboard while you click photos). Control-clicking will put a blue border around your photos that will be exported (remember, the original will stay there, but it will export a small copy). Here is what the blue border looks like when you have your photos selected:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/2954438537_abe7ba7be0_o.jpg" alt="blue-border" width="494" height="249" /></center></p>
<p>Once you have them properly selected, they will appear in the Picasa Tray in the lower left corner of the Picasa window. The tray works just like a printer queue and holds files there until you are ready to perform an action or do something with them:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2955284060_1b5ec3b19d_o.jpg" alt="tray" width="477" height="313" /></center></p>
<p>If you want to hold photos in the tray, simply click the Green Tack, and it will hold them there until you are ready to Export. When you have selected all of the images you want to Export, click the Export button at the lower center section of the Picasa window:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/2955283968_dfc8e25a60_o.jpg" alt="export" width="408" height="352" /></center></p>
<p>This pops up the Export dialog box and asks you where you want to save the small copies of your photos. It also gives you a convenient slider to choose how large you want your photos. The default is 800 (which means the longest edge of your photos will be 800 pixels long). 800 or 640 would be good sizes to choose if you are going to e-mail your photos. The more photos you plan on e-mailing at a time, the smaller you will want this setting to be:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2955282050_12b5189ba4_o.jpg" alt="Export dialog box" width="377" height="508" /></center></p>
<p>Picasa saves the "Exported Photos" to a folder in your My Pictures folder by default, but I don't think this is very helpful, or easy to find, so I recommend saving to the Desktop. Click "Browse" and another box will pop up asking you where you want to save these new photos:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3187/2954436915_47aacd4463_o.jpg" alt="where to export" width="326" height="358" /></center></p>
<p>Click Desktop at the top, then click OK. This takes you back to the Export window. Click OK and it will save your photos to their new location. When it is done, it will pop open an Explorer window showing the location of your new photos:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2955283932_1a610ec64e_m.jpg" alt="exported photos" width="240" height="180" /></center></p>
