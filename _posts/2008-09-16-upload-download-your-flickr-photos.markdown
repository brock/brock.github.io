<p><strong>My Collection of Flickr Tools</strong>: <br />
<a href="http://flickr.com/tools/">Flickr Uploadr</a>: When I was getting everything up to Flickr initially, I used the flickr uploadr at the top of this page: <a href="http://flickr.com/tools/">http://flickr.com/tools/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.greggman.com/pages/flickrdown.htm">FlickrDown</a>: I've always gone back to this program to download photos quickly, because I like the interface. But it does not have a real easy way to backup all your photos. It was designed to backup your sets, but if some of your photos are not in a set, they don't get downloaded: <a href="http://www.greggman.com/pages/flickrdown.htm">http://www.greggman.com/pages/flickrdown.htm</a></p>
<p>So I started using <a href="http://sunkencity.org/flickredit">FlickrEdit</a> to download all the photos at once. It has a "backup" feature as well that apparently keeps track of all of your photos and can tell if more were uploaded to Flickr since the last backup. I am not confident that it got all of my photos just because I have over 10,000, but once I get all of the photos in sync, it will be a lot easier to keep up with it: <a href="http://sunkencity.org/flickredit">http://sunkencity.org/flickredit</a></p>
