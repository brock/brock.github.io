<p><strong>How to Tile Windows Vertically (or Horizontally) in Windows XP</strong></p>
<p>If you are just learning Windows XP, or are starting an ambitious project of getting your photos organized, it is helpful to know how to move your Windows Explorer windows around on the screen. You might compare this to <em>sorting laundry inside the basket</em>, or being able to create piles on the bed or a table. Windows XP allows you to move your explorer windows around so they are easier to use.</p>
<p>When I am organizing my photos, I like to <em>tile the windows vertically</em>. For example, if you have two explorer windows open, and they are stacked on top of each other like below, you'll have a hard time 'dragging & dropping' photos between the two folders:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3072/2953470160_9256c95c85.jpg" alt="Before Tile Vertically" width="500" height="400" /></center></p>
<p>So what we want to do is <em>select</em> the two windows so that we can tile them vertically. We do this by clicking one of them in the taskbar at the bottom of the screen (notice that only one is darkened, or selected):</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3161/2952631003_c16a69d4f4_o.jpg" alt="One Taskbar Button Selected" width="262" height="93" /></center></p>
<p>Then to select the other window, we hold down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key on the keyboard and then click the other button in the taskbar for the other window. This will select both windows (they will be dark). </p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2953472872_73a166c6a8_o.jpg" alt="Control Click" width="374" height="69" /></center></p>
<p>Then you <strong>right-click</strong> with your mouse over one of the buttons and a menu will pop up giving you the option to <em>Tile Vertically</em>:</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2952622391_9dac659c4b_o.jpg" alt="Tile Vertically" width="358" height="166" /></center></p>
<p>After you click Tile Vertically, the selected windows will fill the screen and be visible. Now you can drag and drop! </p>
