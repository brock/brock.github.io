<h2>List View</h2>

<p>I am a huge fan of List view. This is how most of my folders are setup when I'm not organizing photos. It is organized from top to bottom, and it is easy to find things at a quick glance. So if I sort them alphabetically, "A" is at the top and "B" is right below it (instead of to the right of it). When you have enough folders or files to fill the window, it starts a new column over to the right; so you can fit a lot of information in front of you without having to scroll down. </p>

<p>This mode is very helpful when you are working with a large collection of folders and want to drag things around quickly. You can see from this photo that your folders are all shown together:</p>
