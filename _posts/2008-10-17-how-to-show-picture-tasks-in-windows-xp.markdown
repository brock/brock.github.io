    I found by googling "windows xp picture tasks"!  My computer went away for a service
    last week and when it came back the picture tasks menu was gone.  The man who
    did the service didn't know how to get it back so I'm v happy to have done it
    myself!

<p><strong>How to Show Picture Tasks in Windows XP</strong></p>
<p>If you are trying to manage your digital photos using Windows Explorer, the built-in file manager for Windows XP, you'll want to have a helpful tool turned on called "Picture Tasks" (officially called "Common Tasks"). Open up your official My Pictures folder. It should look like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3231/2950677554_890f0648cd.jpg" alt="MyPictures" width="448" height="336" /> </p>
<p>Notice the menus on the left? There are a lot of helpful tools that you can use in there. But if you opened up My Pictures and didn't see the Picture Tasks, yours probably looked something like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3200/2950677596_2de5cc9d97.jpg" alt="NoCommonTasks" width="448" height="336" /></p>
<p>So if your Picture Tasks aren't showing up, do this:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Right-click on My Computer (usually found on the desktop) and click "Properties":<br/></li>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/2949825943_c11a0682f2.jpg" alt="ComputerProperties" width="268" height="303" /></p>
<li>Then select the Advanced Tab and click the Settings button under Performance:</li>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2949825993_b7217352d1.jpg" alt="PerformanceSettings" width="336" height="390" /> </p>
<li>Scroll down in the white box until you find "Use Common Tasks in Folders" and check that box. Now click OK.</li>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/2949826033_cb655a569b.jpg" alt="CommonTasks" width="307" height="448" />
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And you're done! You should now have Picture Tasks when you open My Pictures.</p>
