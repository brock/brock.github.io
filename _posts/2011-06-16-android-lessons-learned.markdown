<blockquote><p>In the development justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the staffers who write Android code and the developers who convert this code into apps. These are their stories.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a link to a Google Doc I'm keeping called "<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1pge4qQlh1P-AKQ_JIzaL24B6iET7Kg1SIinbrFGeEFE">Things That Fixed Major Errors in Android</a>". Its my attempt to stay organized and not make the same mistake twice. </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
