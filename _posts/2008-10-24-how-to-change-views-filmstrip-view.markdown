<h2>Filmstrip View</h2>
<p>The last mode that is available is called "Filmstrip". Filmstrip is not even in your list of choices if you don't have any photos in the folder. And if you are in Filmstrip View mode, and try clicking on something like a text file or a Word document, it will say that it can't generate a preview. It is only for photos. Filmstrip is great though, because it will show you a larger preview of your photo right inside of Windows Explorer; and if you maximize the window, it will enlarge the photo to fill the screen. </p>

<p>You can click the little blue arrows to navigate through your photos and you can click the green <strong>rotate clockwise </strong>and <strong>rotate counter-clockwise</strong> icons to quickly correct photo orientation.</p>
