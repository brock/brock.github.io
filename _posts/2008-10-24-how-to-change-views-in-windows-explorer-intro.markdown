<p><strong>How to Change Views in Windows Explorer: Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Windows has a built-in file manager called "Windows Explorer" that shows you the files and folders that are on your computer. Windows Explorer works great, but unfortunately, it doesn't always display your files and folders the same way. This can be really confusing when you are learning how to use Windows.</p>
<p>Windows Explorer has 6 total "<strong>view modes</strong>" you can choose from (you might only see 5 right now) that simply change the way your files are displayed. All of your files stay in the same place, they are just presented differently. You select the different view modes by clicking the View menu in an Explorer window. </p>

<p>There is also an easy button for changing your views. It is usually located at the top of your Windows Explorer window, but below your file menu, and it looks like the picture below. Just click on it, and it will pop up a menu of the same view mode choices:</p>

<p>No matter which way you select your view mode, it will be a <em>bulleted</em> list, so you'll only use one view mode at a time. (I'll be going to the View Menu at the top of the screen through the remainder of this tutorial - like in the first photo) </p>
<p>You can set all of your folders to use the same view mode. For example, you might like <strong>Thumbnail View </strong>mode and want every folder you open to use <strong>Thumbnail View </strong>mode. But I don't recommend using the same view mode all the time. That's because each view mode is designed for a specific job. It would be kind of like mowing your lawn with scissors. :)  Plus, you'd be missing out on one of the great parts of having a computer: it allows you to do tedious work quickly and have fun while you're doing it! Let's take a look at some examples. Click on number 2: How to Change Views - Thumbnails View<br />
