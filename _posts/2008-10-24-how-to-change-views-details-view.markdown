<h2>Details View</h2>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/2965917480_b2ec005acc_o.jpg" alt="Details Menu" border=2 width="153" height="213" /></center><br />

<p>Details View is the most powerful of all of the view modes. Instead of your files spanning the entire window, they are now docked to the left. Your files and folders stay in a single column on the left side of the window. The remaining columns are used to display data about the files and folders. What's more, you can customize what data shows up in your columns, and you can sort by any of the columns as well.</p>

<h1>
</h1>
<p>To get started with the Details View mode, right click on one of the column headers. You'll see a menu pop up that will have check marks next to the columns that are currently visible. If you want to add a column, just check the box. Unchecking will remove the column as well. </p>

<p>A popular column choice is called "Date Picture Taken". Now you'll be able to sort your photos by the date and time that you took them! But "Date Picture Taken" doesn't appear on the default menu, you have to click "More":</p>

<h1>
</h1>
<p>This pops up the Column chooser. There are many columns to choose from. Simply check next to the columns that you want visible. If you want to rearrange them, simply select a field, and click Move Up or Move Down to adjust:</p>

<h1>
</h1>
<p>You'll also notice that your photos are sorted (probably by name) when you open the Details View. If you look closely, there is a gray triangle that is suppose to represent an up arrow or a down arrow. Clicking on the top of a column will sort your folder by that column (for example, Sort by <em>Date Picture Taken</em>) and it will put the gray triangle next to the column header to indicate that it is sorting by that column:</p>

<h1>
</h1>
<p>Want to reverse the sort order? You simply click the column header again (that's the gray bar where the name of the column is) and it will reverse your sort order:</p>

<p>You can fully customize the way Details View looks and works, so it earns the title "Most Powerful" :)</p>
