excerpt: Keywords are already built into Firefox, and they are faster than clicking
  a bookmark if you are comfortable with the keyboard.

<p>The time is coming when the only program you'll use on your computer is your web browser, and all applications will be replaced by web pages. Here is a tip for getting to those pages faster and more efficiently.</p>
<p>Firefox has a feature built into each bookmark called a "keyword". Think of this like a keyboard-shortcut for the web address. So instead of going to the address bar and typing: "http://www.google.com" and hitting enter, you go to the address bar and just type "g" and hit enter.</p>
<p>Here are my most-used keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>g - google.com</li>
<li>f - facebook.com</li>
<li>gm - gmail.com</li>
<li>v - vista.bu.edu (school)</li>
<li>e - elance.com</li>
</ul>
<p>The nice thing is that you can create and change these to whatever you want, whenever you want. Here's how you create a keyword for a bookmark:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on a bookmark anywhere in Firefox</li>
<li>Select Properties at the bottom</li>
<li>In the "Keywords" box, type the letters you'd like to use for the shortcut (like "f" or "gm", without the quotes)</li>
<li>Now go to the address bar (Alt-D on PC, Command-L on Mac), type your new keyword, and press enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a commonly overlooked feature of Firefox that has been around forever, but it makes browsing so much faster.</p>
